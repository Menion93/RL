# ReinforcementLearning

In this repository are implemented reinforcement learning algorithm in python, starting from basics algorithms like iterative policy evaluation up deep Q learning.

## Algorithms
* Smart Agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe
* Iterative Policy Evaluation
* Policy Iteration on Deterministic and Stochastic Environments
* ... and more

## Run
To run the algorithm, just launch it with `python <filename>`
